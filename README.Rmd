# ChromoCorrect

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

ChromoCorrect is an R Package and R Shiny app that detects and corrects for chromosomal location bias in read counts.

## Installation

You can install the development version of ChromoCorrect from [GitHub](https://github.com/) in R with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("BarquistLab/ChromoCorrect")
```
## Dependencies

### RTools
Some packages rely on R packages from source which requires RTools to download. 


Windows: download RTools from https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/


MacOS: the Xcode suite (if not already installed) is available at https://developer.apple.com/xcode/resources/


### Bioconductor
There are some R packages required to be installed from Bioconductor. If they do not download as dependencies when installing ChromoCorrect, you can install them yourself below:

```{r eval=FALSE}
if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install(c("locfit", "edgeR", "limma"))
```


## Example - running the app

To start the shiny app:

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(ChromoCorrect)
launch_app()
```

## Further instructions

Please see the [Instructions](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/BarquistLab/ChromoCorrect/blob/master/inst/Instructions.html) file for detailed information on running the ChromoCorrect app or the commands independently of the app.
